    <h1>Six-pont programme</h1>
    <p>
        Six-point Program a charter of demands enunciated by the Awami League for removing disparity between the two wings of
        Pakistan and to put an end to the internal colonial rule of West Pakistan in East Bengal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Indo-Pak War of 1965 ended with the exclusion of Taskent Treaty. To the old grievances of economic disparity added
        the complain of negligence and indifference of center government towards the defiance of East Pakistan. Bangabandhu
        Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was vocal on this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        The leaders of the opposition parties of West Pakistan convened a national convention at Lahore on 6 February 1966 with
        a view to ascertain the post-Taskent political trend. Bangabandhu reached Lahore on 4 February along with the top
        leaders of Awami League, and the day following he placed the Six-point charter of demand before the subject committee as
        the demands of the people of East Pakistan. He created pressure to include his proposal in the agenda of t he
        conference. The subject committee rejected the proposal of Bangabandhu. On the day following, the newspapers of West
        Pakistan published reports on the Six-point Program, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was projected as a separatist.
        Consequently, Sheikh Mujib abandoned the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Six-point Program along with a proposal of movement for the realization of the demands was placed before the meeting
        of the working committee of Awami League on 21 February 1966, and the proposal was carried out unanimously. A booklet on
        the Six-point Program with interdiction form Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Tajuddin Ahmad was published. Another
        booklet titled Amader Banchar Dabi: 6-Dafa Karmasuchi(Our demands for existence: 6-Pont Program) was published in the
        name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and was distributes in the council meeting of Awami League held on 18 March 1966.

        Six-points:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Constitute should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore Resolution, and the
                parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a Legislature directly elected based on universal adult franchise.
            </li>
            <li>
                The federal government should deal with only two subjects: Defense and Foreign Affairs, and all other residuary
                subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two separates, but freely convertible currencies foe two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible,
                there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop
                the flight of capital form East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate Banking Reserve should be established, and
                separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.
            </li>
            <li>
                The power of Taxation and Revenue collection she'll be vested in the Federating units and the federal Center will
                have no such power on the issue. The federation will be entitled to a share in the state of Texas to meet its
                expenditures.
            </li>
            <li>
                There should be two separated accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange
                requirement of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally of in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous
                products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the Constitution should empower the units to establish
                trade links with foreign countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                East Pakistan should have a separate military or paramilitary force.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The opposition leaders of West Pakistan looked at Mujibâ€™s Six-point program as a device to disband Pakistan, and hence
        they rejected his proposal outright. The Ayub government projected Sheikh Mujib as a separatist and the later instituted
        the Agartala conspiracy case against him. He was arrested and put on trial. The case led to widespread agitation in East
        Pakistan culminating into the mass uprising of early 1969. Under public pressure, the government was forced to release
        him unconditionally on 22-February 1969.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Awami League sought public mandate in favor of the Six-point Program in the general elections of 1970 in which
        Sheikh Mujib received the absolute mandate from the people of East Pakistan in favor of his Six-point. But Zulfiqar Ali
        Bhatto refused to join session of the National Assembly scheduled to be held on 3 March 1971 unless a statement was
        reached between the two leaders beforehand. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party sat in a protracted dialogue from 15
        March 1971. The dialogue failed to produce any positive result. The army crackdown of 25 March sealed the fate of the
        Six-point including the fate of Pakistan.
