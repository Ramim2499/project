        <b>Bara-Bhuians</b>, or twelve territorial landlords were the local chiefs and zamindars who put up strong resistance to the
        Mughals during the time of Akbar and jahangir. The team Bara-Bhuiyans means twelve territorial landholders. But who
        these bhuiyans were could not be identified accurately for a long time. In fact, during the interregnum between Afghan
        rule and the rise of Mushal power in Bengal, various parts of Bengal passed to the control of several military
        chiefs,bhuiyans and zamindars. They jointly and more often severally resisted Mughal expansion and ruled their
        respective territories as independent or semi-independent chiefs. There was no central control, or if there was any, it
        was nominal. In such circumstances many bhuiyans raised their heads. Taking the whole Bengal into consideration, the
        number of bhuiyans must be more than twelve.

    <p>    
        One group of scholars says the term Bara Bhuiyan does not necessarily mean exactly twelve bhuiyans, the term was applied
        loosely to mean many. As number twelve was sacred to Hindus, these scholars examined traditions from scriptures to find
        out in which of the cases the number twelve was used. They applied the term Bara-Bhuians. Even the fighters against the
        Mughals were many more than twelve, so this group also failed to identify the Bara-Bhuians.
    </p>
        
    <p>    
        In recent years, the question of identification of Bara-Bhuiyans has been stududes afresh and they have been identified
        quite satisfactorily. Modern scholars have found that the Bara-Bhuiyans flourished during the chaotic period of Afghan
        rule and the period of the conquest of Bengal by the Mughal emperors Akbar and Jahangir. So the Bara-Bhuiyans received
        proper treatment from Mughal historians, Abul Fazl, the author of the akbarnama, and Mirza Nathan, the author of the
        baharistan-i-ghaybi. Both of them used the numeric word ithna-ashara(twelve), to denote the Bara-Bhuiyans; it means that
        the word ‘Bara-Bhuyan’ was not a vague term, rather it gives the exact number of the bhuiyans. They also categorically
        say that the twelve Bhuiyans (Bara-Bhuiyan) were people of Bhati and rose to power in Bhati. But the identification of
        Bhati has not been satisfactorily ascertained.
    </p>    
        
    <p>    
        On the basis of the confusing statement of the European writers, previous scholars also were in confusion about the
        identification of Bhati. The Bara-Bhuiyans fought against the Mughals in the regions of emperors Akbar and Jahangir, and
        they were compelled to submit within a few years of Jahangir’s accession. So Bhati of the Bara-Bhuiyans may be
        identified with the help of the Mughal histories, mainly the Akbarnam, the ain-i-akbari and the Baharistan-i-Ghaybi. In
        Bengal the word Bhati generally means low lying region and the entire low-lying area of Bengal in Bhati. It is a
        riverine country, and most of it remains inundated for more than half of the year; the mighty rivers the Ganges, the
        Brahaputra and their numerous branches wash and water the whole of eastern and southern Bengal.
    </p>    
        
    <p>    
        Modern scholars have, therefore, suggested that different low-lying tracts front the Bhagirathi to the Meghna in Bhati,
        some others in Bhati Hijli, Jessore, Chandradwip and Bakerganj. Keeping in view the theatre of warfare between the
        Bara-Bhuiyans and the Mughals, and on the basis of the details of hte warfare as given in the Akbarnama and the
        Baharistan-i-Ghaybi the limits of Bhati, where the Bara-Bhuiyans flourished and rose to power, may be determined as the
        area bounded by the river Ichamati in the west, the Gangas in the south, the kingdom of Tippers in the east and
        Alapsingh pargana (in greater Mymensingh) stretching northeast to Banichang(in great Sylhet) in the north. So the
        low-lying area of the greater districts of Dhaka, Mymensingh, Trippers and Sylhet, watered and surrounded by the Ganges,
        the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna and their numerous branches constituted Bhati in the days of Akbar and Jahangir. The
        Bara-Bhuiyans rose to power in this region and put up resistance to the Mughals, until islam khan chisti made them
        submit in the reign of Jahangir.
    </p>    
    <p>    
        Mughal historians, Abul Fazl and Mirza Nathan, state the number of Bhuiyans as twelve, but it should be remembered that
        the Bara-Bhuiyans of the time of Akbar were not the same as those of the time of Jahangir, because some died in the
        intervening period. For example, Usa Khan, who fought against Akbar, died in his reign and was succeeded by his sin musa
        khan, who took up leadership in the region of Jahangir. Some parganas changed hands in the meantime; for example, anand
        rai and kedar rai were zamindars of Vikramapura and Sripur in the region of Akbar, but in the region of Jahangir the
        family was probably extinct, so that the parganas were found in the hands of Musa Khan. After the Mughal campaign in
        Bhati, as found in the Akbarname, the following list of the Bhuiyans may be drawn up: (i) Isa Khan Masnad-i-Ala, (ii)
        Ibrahim Naral, (iii) Karimdad Musazai, (iv) Majlis Dilwarm (v) Majlis Pratap, (vi) Kedar Rai, (vii) Sher Khan, (viii)
        Bhadur Ghazi, (ix) Tila Ghazi, (x) Chand Ghazi, (xi)Sultan Ghazi, (xii) Selim Ghazi, (xiii) Qasim Ghazi.
    </p>    
        
     <p>   
        In the Baharistan-i-Ghaybi, the names of Musa Khan and his 12 zamindar allies are as follows: (i) Musa khan
        Masnad-i-Ala, (ii)Alaul Khan, (iii)Abdul Khan, (iv) Mahmud Khan, (v) Bahadur Ghazi, (vi) Sona Ghazi, (vii) Anwar Ghazi,
        (viii) Shaikh Pir, (ix) Mirza Mumin, (x) Madhav Rai, (xii) Pahlwan, (xiii) Haji Shamsuddin Baghadadi.

    <p>    
        The patriotic Bhuiyans, who resisted the MUghal conquest, were famous as Bara-Bhuiyans or twelve Bhuiyans, but in both
        above lists, there are thirteen names. Actually they were thirteen including the leader, and in fact both Abul Fazl and
        Mirza Nathan, while referring to the Bara-Bhuiyans, wrote, Isa Khan made the 12 zamindars of Bengal subject of himself,
        and elsewhere Mirza Nathan wrote Musa Khan and his 12 zamindar allies.
    </p>    
    <p>    
        The Bara-Bhuiyans gained strength during the chaotic conditions prevailing in eastern Bengal following the disruption of
        the two-hundred-year old independence sultan Bengal following the disruption of the two-hundred-year old independent
        sultanate in 1538 AD. Later Sher Shah’s policy of decentralisation had this bad effect in proved by the several
        rebellions in eastern Bengal against him. The Afghan historians described this state of affairs by using the term
        Muluk-ut-tawaif, which means disorder, chaos and disintegration.
    </p>    
    <p>    
        It is evident that after the fall of the independent sultanate (1538 AD) and particularly after the decentralisation of
        administration by Sher Shah, a chaotic condition and disruptive forces prevailed, particularly in eastern Bengal in the
        region of Bhati; and during this period of chaos, the Bara-Bhuiyans gained strength and rose to power. The Bara-Bhuiyans
        were heirs to the two-hundred-year long independence sultanate of Bengal.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The Bara-Bhuiyans were not the scions of any royal family, they were zamindars of landholders. They were patriots who
        with courage and valour resisted the Mughal advance for many decades. After 1612 when Islam Khan Chishti forced them to
        submit, the term Bar-Bhuiyans survived only in popular tales and ballads.
