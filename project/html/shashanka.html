    <h1>Gupta Dynasty</h1>
    <h2>Shashanka</h2>
    <p><b>Shashanka </b>the first importent king of ancient Bengal occupies a prominent place in history of the region. It is generally belived that he ruled approximately between 600 AD and 625 AD. The ruler of any big region under the Gupta kings was called 'Mohashamanta'. Sasanka was a 'Mohashamanta' of the Gupta king Mahashena Gupta.</p>
    <p><u>Sources:</u> Two dated inscriptions, issued in his 8th and 10th regnal years from Midnapore, and another undated insctiption from Egra near Kharagpur have been discovered. Besides Shashanka's subordinate kings of Ganjam (Orissa) copper plate (dated 619 AD), Harshavardhan's Banskhera and Madhavan copper plates and the Nidhapur copper plate of the Kamarupa king Bhaskara Varman contain information about Shashanka.</p>
    <p><u>Coins:</u> Shashanka issued gold and silver coins. A number of independent rulers flourished in Bengal in the intereniing period beetween the decline of Guptas and the rise of Shashanka, and their existence is known from a few inscriptions and gold coins. Besides the seal-matrix of 'Shri Mahasamanta Shashanka' from Rohtasgarh and the contemporary literary accounts of Banabhtta and the Chinese pilgrim <u>HIUEN-TSANG</u> and the Buddhist test <em>Artamanjushrimulakalpa</em> are important sources of information.</p>
    <p><u>Capital:</u> Shashanka established the capital in Karnasuborana.</p>
    <p><u>Area:</u> The powerful Shashanka extended his kingdom by conquering the kingdom of Dandbhukti. Utkal of Prissa, Kingdom of Kanghod and Magadha of Bihar. THe Kings of Kamrupa were also defated by him.</p>
    <p><u>Politial Influence:</u> Under this perspective Shashanka attempted to extend his political influence in different parts of India. Shashanka next thought of couquering North India. There were two powerful kingdoms in Nourth Indian at that time. One was thanneshwar under the pushyabuti  Dynasty and other was Kanyakubza(Kanauj) under the Maukhari dynasty. Maukhari king Grahavarma married Rajyashri, daughter of pushyabhuti king probhakar Vardhana. The two kingdoms became friendly as a result of it. Rajyavardhana and Harshavardhana were the two brothrs of Rajyasri. Shashanka became determined to uproot the Maukharis, the perpetual enemies of the Guptas. For this reason, he made an alliance with Devagupta, the king of Malaba.</p>
    <p>Grahavarma was defeted and killed at the hands of Devagupta even before Shashanka could reach North India. Rajyashri was then the king og thanneshwar. He put up resistence to Devagupta on the way. Devgupta was defeted ans killed. Rajyavardhana then advanced towards Kanauj. He came face with Shashanka on the way. In the fight that followed Rajyavardhana was defeated and defeated and made a peisoner. Later he was put to death. </p>
