    <h1>Language Movement</h1>
    <p>
        The Language Movement began in 1945 and reached its climax in the killing of 21 February 1952, and ended in the adoption
        of Bangla as one of the state languages of Pakistan. The question as to what would be the state language of Pakistan was
        raised immediately after its creation. The central leaders and the Urdu- speaking intellectuals of Pakistan declared
        that Urdu would be the state language of Pakistan, just as Hindi was the state language of Pakistan. The question as to
        what would be the state language of Pakistan was raised immediately after its creation. The central leaders and the
        Urdu-speaking intellectuals of Pakistan declared that Urdu would be the state language of Pakistan, just as Hidi was the
        state language of India. The students and intellectuals of East Pakistan. However, demanded thatBangla be made one of
        the state languages. After a lot of controversy over the language issue, the final demand from East Pakistan was that
        Bangla must be the official language and the medium of instruction in East Pakistan and for the central government it
        would be one of the state languages along with Urdu. The first movement on this issue was mobilised by Tamaddun Majlish
        headed by Professor Abul Kashem. Gradually many other non-communal and progressive organisations joined the movement.
        Which finally turned into a mass movement
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, serious preparation was being taken in various forums of the central government of Pakistan under the
        initiative of Fazlur Rahman, the central education minister, to make Urdu the only state language of Pakistan. On
        receipt of this information, East Pakistani students became agitated and hels one of the state languages of Pakistan.
        The meeting was followed by student processions and more agitation. The first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad(Language
        Action Committee) was formed towards the end of December with Professor Nurul Huq Bhuiyan of Tamaddun Majlish as
        convener.

        The Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was in session at Karachi then the capital of Pakistan from 23 February 1948. It
        was proposed that the members would have to speak either in Urdu or in English at the Assembly. Dhirendranath Datta, a
        member from the East Pakistan Congress Pray, moved an amendment motion to include Bangla as one of the languages of the
        Constituent Assembly. He noted that out of the 6 crore 90 lakh population of Pakistan, 4 crore 40 lakh were from East
        Pakistan with Bangla as their mother tongue. The central leaders, including Liaquat ali khan, Prime minister of
        Pakistan, and Khwaja mazimuddin, chief minister of East Bengal, opposed the motion. On receiving the news that the
        motion had been rejected, students, intellectuals and politicians of East Pakistan became agitated. Newspapers such as
        the Azad also criticised the politicians who rejected the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new committee to fight for Bangla as the state language was formed with Shamsul Huq as convener. On 11 March 1948 a
        general strike was observed in the towns of East Pakistan in Protest against the omission of Bangla from the languages
        of the Constituent Assembly. The
        Absence of Bangla letters in Pakistani coins and stamps, and the use of only Urdu in recruitment tests for the navy. The
        movement also reiterated the earlier demand that Bangla be declared one of the start languages of Pakistan and and the
        official language of East Pakistan. Amidst processions, picketing and slogans, leaders such as Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam
        Mahboob, Shamsul Huq. Oil Ahad, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Abdul Wahed and others were arrested. Student leaders, including
        Abdul Matin and Abdul Malek ukil, also took part in the Procession and picketing.
    </p>
    <p>
        A meeting was held on the Dhaka University premises. Mohammed Toaha was severely injured while trying to snatch away a
        rifle from a policeman and had to be admitted to hospital. Strikes were observed from 12 March to 15 March.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under such circumstances the government had to give in. Khawaja Nazimuddin signed an agreement with the student leaders.
        However, although he agreed to a few terms and conditions, he did not comply with their demand that Bangla be made a
        state language. Muhammed Ali Jinnah, the governor general of Pakistan, came to visit East Pakistan on 19 March. He
        addressed two meetings in Dhaka, in both of which he ignored the popular demand for Bangla. He reiterated that Urdu
        would be the only state language of Pakistan on 19 March. He addressed two meetings in Dhaka, in both of which he
        ignored the popular demand for Bangal. He reiterated that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. This
        declaration was instantly protested with the Language Movement spreading throughout East Pakistan. The Dhaka University
        Language Action Committee was formed on 11 March 1950 with Abdul Matin as its convener.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the beginning of 1952, the Language Movement took a serious turn. Both Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan were dead, Jinnah
        on 11 September 1948 and Liaquat Ali Khan on 16 October 1951. Khwaja Nazimuddin had succeeded Liaquat Ali Khan as prin
        minister of Pakistan. With the political crisis. The economic condition in East Pakistan also deteriorated. The people
        of East Pakistan started losing faith in the Muslim League. A new party, the Awami Mislim League which would later
        become the Awami league was formed under the leadership of Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani in 1949. There was a growing
        sense of deprivation and exploitation in East Pakistan and a realisation that a new form of colonialism had replaced
        British imperialism. Under these circumstances, the Language Movement got a new momentum in 1952.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 27 January 1952, Khwaja Nazimuddin came to Dhaka from Karachi, Addressing a meeting at Paltan Mainda. He said that
        the people of the province could decide what would be the provincial language, nut only Urdu would be the state language
        of Pakistan. There was an instant negative reaction to this speech among the students who reponed with the slogan,
        ‘Rashtrabhasha Bangla Chai’ (We want Bangla as the state language).
    </p>
    <p>
        A strike was observed at Dhaka University on 30 January. The representatives of various political and cultural
        organizations held meeting on 31 January chaired by Moulana Bhasani. An All-Party Central Language Action Committee was
        formed with Kazi Golam Mohboob as its convener. At this time the government also proposed that Bangla be written in
        Arabi script. This proposal was also vehemently opposed. The Language Action Committee decided to call a hartal and
        organize demonstrations and processions on February 21 throughout East Pakistan.
    </p>
    <p>
        As preparation for demonstrations were underway, the government-imposed Section 144 in the city of Dhaka, banning all
        assemblies and demonstrations. A meeting of the Central Language Action Committee was held on 20 February under the
        chairmanship of Abul Hashim. Opinion was divided as to whether to violated Section 144.
    </p>
    <p>
        The students were determined to violate Section 144 and held a student meeting at 11.00 am on 21 February on the Dhaka
        University campus, then located close to the Medical College Hospital. When the meeting started, the Vice-Chancellor,
        along with a few university teachers, came to the sport and requested the student not to Violate the ban on assembly.
        However, the students under their leaders – Abdul Matin and Gaziul Haque were adamant. Thousands of students from
        different schools and colleges of Dhaka assembled on the university campus while armed police waited outside the gate.
        When the students emerged in groups, shouting slogans, the police resorted to baton charge; even the female students
        were not spared.
    </p>
    <p>
        The student then started throwing brickbats at the police, who retaliated with tear gas. Unable to control the agitated
        students, the police fired upon the crowd of students, who were proceeding towards the Assembly Hall (at present part of
        Jagannath Hall, University of Dhaka). Three young men, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abdul Jabbar and Abdul Barkat (an MA student
        of Political Science) were fatally wounded. Many injured persons were agminated to the hospital. Along them Abdus Salam,
        a peon at the Secretariat, subsequently succumbed to his wounds. A nine-year-old boy named Ohiullah was also killed.

        At the Legislative Assembly building, the session was about to begin. Hearing the news of the shooting. Some members of
        the Assembly, including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabasish and some opposition members, went out and joined the students.
        In the Assembly, Nurul Amin, chief minister of East Pakistan, continued to oppose the demand for Bangla.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day 22 February was also a day of public demonstrations and police reprisals. The public performed a janaza
        (prayer service for the dead) and brought out a mourning procession, which was attacked by the police and the army
        resulting in several deaths, including that of a young man named Shafiur Rahman. Many were injured and arrested. On 23
        February, at the spot where students had been killed, a memorial was erected. In 1963, the temporary structure was
        replaced by a concert memorial, the shaheed minar (martyr’s memorial).

    <p>
        The East Bengal Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the recognition of Bangla as one of the state
        languages of Pakistan. The language movement continued until 1956. The movement achieved its goal by forcing the
        Pakistan Constituent Assembly in adopting both Bangla and Urdu as the state language of Pakistan. While the Assembly was
        debating on the language issue, Member Adel Uddin Ahmed (1913 – 1981; Faridpur) made an important amendment proposal,
        which was adopted unanimously by the Assembly (16 February 1956). Both Bangla and Urdu were thus enacted to be the state
        language of Pakistan.
